# horiseon-code-refactor

## Description

This is a refactor of the Horiseon website to improve and eliminate any possible errors.

This is done in order to practice and improve our developing skills, whilst at the same time will show off our work to other developers as well as potential employers.

As good practice, developers should make use of all tools provided. To be able to refactor this website I had to review the recording of the last zoom lesson, which explained step by step how to start debugging.

Some of the errors encountered:
<!-- viewport was missing-->
<!-- removed footer-->
<!-- dry code removed-->
